# Time-Series-Forecasting

1 - Define the problem and perform Exploratory Data Analysis:

    •	Read the data as an appropriate time series data 

    •	Plot the data 

    •	Perform EDA  

    •	Perform Decomposition.

2 - Data Pre-processing: 

    •	Missing value treatment 

    •	Visualize the processed data 

    •	Train-test split

3 - Model Building - Original Data: 

    •	Build forecasting models 

    •	Linear regression 

    •	Simple Average 

    •	Moving Average 

    •	Exponential Models (Single, Double, Triple) 

    •	Check the performance of the models built

4 - Check for Stationarity: 

    •	Check for stationarity 

    •	Make the data stationary (if needed)

5 - Model Building - Stationary Data: 

    •	Generate ACF & PACF Plot and find the AR, MA values. 

    •	Build different ARIMA models - Auto ARIMA - Manual ARIMA 

     •	Build different SARIMA models - Auto SARIMA - Manual SARIMA 

     •	Check the performance of the models built.

6 - Compare the performance of the models: 

    •	Compare the performance of all the models built 

    •	Choose the best model with proper rationale 

    •	Rebuild the best model using the entire data 

    •	Make a forecast for the next 12 months.

7 - Actionable Insights & Recommendations: 
                    
    Conclude with the key takeaways (actionable insights and recommendations) for the business.
